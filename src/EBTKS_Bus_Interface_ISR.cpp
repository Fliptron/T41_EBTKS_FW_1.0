//  HP85 bus emulation
//      Interrupt on:
//        Phi 1 Rising
//        Phi 2 Rising
//      Logic derived from the reverse engineered ROM drawer board by Jorge Amodio
//        See HP82929A-v3.2_by_Jorge.pdf
//
//  These functions area all running within an ISR, The all need to be short and fast
//
//    The Phi 2 Rising interupt is used to sample the control lines /LMAX, /RDX, /WRX to decide on the cycle type.
//    This is where most of the decissions take place, and the timing in this ISR is not too critical.
//    If the operation is a read, this is where we will be initiating puting data onto the bus and asserting /RCX
//
//    The Phi 1 Rising interrupt is more timing sensitive. If EBTKS is outputting data (bus read from the processor's
//    point of view), we initiated output back in Phi 2. The responsibility in this ISR is to turn the data off,
//    approximately 100 ns AFTER the falling edge of Phi 1.
//    Alternatively, if the processor is doing a bus write, and the address matches one of the addresses that EBTKS
//    must respond to (by reading the value off the bus), the data may become valid as late as 80 ns before the
//    Rising edge of Phi 1. We capture the data somewhat after the Rising edge of Phi 1. The timing for this is fairly tight.
//    If it ever turns out this is too soon, we could add a 100 ns delat (thus mid Phi 1 pulse) which should fix things.
