# Commit Details

It seems the Check-ins to the repo have way too many minor, major, and cosmetic
changes, so the limited comment line really does not cover what has changed.
Starting with Commit 76 on 11/22/2020 , I will try and do better, and keep track of what is going on in this file.


## Commit \#76 11/22/2020

Changes:
-   Locked which version of **SdFat** and **FastLed** libraries are used in platformio.ini lib_deps section
-   Moved the Boot Log output to the Poll Loop, improvements to how it is displayed
-   Improved handling of SD Card if it is not installed
-   Fix to HPIBOutput()
-   SDREN re-write
-   Minimal Verbose reporting added to all Keywords. More to come.
-   Improvements to the built-in Logic Analyzer output formatting
-   Resolve_Path() now trims leading and trailing spaces from the new path
-   Many minor documentation improvements in about 12 files
-   TXD diagnostic signal is now pulsed by the built-in Logic Analyzer to trigger
    an external Logic Analyzer. This allows comparison of the two Logic Analyzers,
    and the built-in Logic Analyzer now has time stamps on all sample to
    facilitate this capability. This needs to be made conditional so that TXD can be used for other diagnostic purposes
-   A deliberate glitch in the RXD diagnostic signal used to separate Phi 1
    from Phi 2 interrupt processing has been removed, as it contributed a
    minor additional delay to the RC signal.
-   Moved the built-in Logic Analyzer code in Phi 2 processing to after RC
    is asserted, thus reducing the delay to the start of RC. There is more
    work to be done on this front.
-   Started adding support for HP86/86 type ROMs, and the special ROM headers
    for the Secondary AUXROMs.
-   Minor bug fixed in the built-in Logic Analyzer if Ctrl-C was used to end
    the prior acquisition. Affected re-issuing `la go` without doing a new `la setup`
-   With the recent acquisition of a better external Logic analyzer, documented
    the new probing arrangement: `Logic Analyzer Configuration 6 for TLA5201`

### What's going on

There has been an ongoing search for what is causing random failures of the
status reported by the SDREN (rename a file on the SD Card, including changing
the path). The command always does as intended (assuming correct parameters)
but can report either that the command failed, or even a general SD error.
It appears that the issue is the timing of the RC signal has a late start.
The current working theory is that something in the SdFat library, or the
SDIO library that it depends on is delaying the start of RC being asserted,
possibly due to DMA activity on the Teensy 4.1  . Yet other commands that do
reads and writes to the SD card do not show the problem to the same extent.
This commit rearranged some of the code in the Phi 2 processing (where RC
is controlled) seems to have mitigated the issue but further work is required
to achieve a better level of confidence.

Oscilloscope captures still indicate the RC signal generated by EBTKS still
violates timing spec Tif2 (380 ns max) from the 1MB5 spec, by 100 ns.

Fixing this will involve the most of the timing critical code in
`   EBTKS_Bus_Interface_ISR.cpp`

One of the attempted workarounds was to put the HP85 into DMA hold while
this statement executed:
`   rename_status = SD.rename(Resolved_Old_Path, Resolved_Path);`

Yet even this failed, casting doubt on the above theory of the root cause
of the problem.

Another experiment involved moving the storage for all the ROMs from DMAMEM
to FASTRUN memory. It only had a minor effect on the issue. This should be
tried again after other experiments have been tried and implemented.

## Commit \#78 11/23/2020

Changes:
-   Modify MOUNT for tape and disk when the media needs to be created. Now uses
    a shared copy function that is also used for SDCOPY.
-   Implemented SDCOPY

## Commit \#79 11/25/2020

Changes:
-   Updated the possible error messages and AUXERRN numbers reported in
    [Keyword Documentation](http://www.fliptronics.com/HP-85_Adventures/AUXROM_Keywords.html)
-   Update the documentation for AUXCMD, AUXOPT$, AUXBUF$ in
    [Keyword Documentation](http://www.fliptronics.com/HP-85_Adventures/AUXROM_Keywords.html)

-   Update some documentation at the top of EBTKS_AUXROM.cpp for AUXCMD, AUXBUF$, AUXOPT$
-   Implement SPRINTF drawing extensively from Everett's emulator code.
    Only the most minimal tests. Crashes HP85 when format string is bad, like "%D"
    about 300 lines of untested code.
-   Disabled USB Host related class instances at top of EBTKS.cpp

## Commit \#80 11/26/2020

Changes:
-   SPRINTF, structure and functionality from Everett, but rewritten in the style
    of the surrounding code, and with many variable names changed, and different
    buffer structure. Also a few bugs found.

## Commit \#81 11/26/2020

Changes:
-   SDCOPY now has an optional Overwrite flag. If no flag is provided, or it is 0
    then Overwrite is an error. If it is 1, the overwrite is allowed.
    Update related website documentation
-   SDSLASH$ Updated related website documentation
-   In EBTKS_SD.cpp, improve documentation about how ROM headers are processed during
    boot, given new support for HP86/87. Also some mostly cosmetic changes to
    other documentation, and some error messages
-   Trivial formatting bug in EBTKS.cpp

## Commit \#82 12/02/2020

Changes:
-   Added SDEOF(file\#) keyword
-   Added SDEXISTS(filePathAndName$) keyword
-   Updated Documentation for SDCAT, SDFFIRST and SDFNEXT. Update the associated custom error messages
-   Implemented EBTKSREV$
    added EBTKS_FIRMWARE_VERSION in EBTKS.h

-   SDCLOSE now sends a message to the serial console for each file closed
-   VERBOSE_KEYWORDS now sends a message to the serial console for each Keyword called
    May also provide additional information
-   Minor changes and more debug serial output for SPRINTF
-   Minor changes to SDREN while debugging Phi 2 to RC timing.

## Commit \#83 12/02/2020

Changes:
-   Added documentation on the Term85 virtual terminal object. By RB
    Light editing by PMF

## Commit \#84 12/03/2020

Changes:
-   Integrate the first pass at EMS support, by RB, into EBTKS_Bus_Interface_ISR.cpp
    also cleaned up some formatting
-   change onReadData() to just use the global addReg rather than passing it as a parameter
    since it is only called from one place, and addReg was the only value that is ever passed to it
-   Removed EBTKS_EXTMEM.cpp, as it was just comments

## Commit \#85 12/12/2020

Changes:
-   First successful attempt at dealing with random bus cycle timing when SD Card
    reads occur using quite Byzantine code (by PMF). Issue was tracked down to a
    small critical region in the SdFat library that was disabling all interrups.
    This then randomly made the EBTKS processing of HP85 bus cycles violate timing.
-   Second successful attempt at dealing with random bus cycle timing when SD Card
    reads occur by changing the operating mode of the SD Card from FIFO_SDIO to
    DMA_SDIO which then leads to the code never going down the path in the SdFat
    library that has the critical section (RB). Unless further issues are
    identified, we will stick with this solution 
-   Change from supporting Pin interrupts for Phi 1 Rising and Phi 2 Rising to
    only Phi 1 Rising
-   Rename onPhi_2_Rise() to mid_cycle_processing() since it is no longer anchored
    to to the Phi 2 rising edge
-   Reorganize all the pin change interrupt code, and make function sequence match
    execution sequence
-   Identify and document all ISR operations. Look for it just prior to
    pinChange_isr() in EBTKS_Bus_Interface_ISR.cpp
-   Change some global functions to local static
-   Extensive changes to EBTKS_Bus_Interface_ISR.cpp
>       Significant new documentation, detailed timing analysis will be in next commit
>       In mid_cycle_processing() move some code that recognizes DMA and Interrupt acknowledgment
>       Merge various ENABLE_EMS_MEMORY code sequences  (was EMC_SUPPORT)

-   Delete some of Philip's code that has been commented out for months
-   Mark places in the code that we need to return to with #### tags
-   Print some dots on the diagnostic terminal when waiting for HP85 to boot after the EBTKS boot
-   Change /roms to /roms85 on the SD Card, in preparation to support HP86/87
-   Removed a 2 second delay in the EBTKS boot process

## Commit \#86 12/12/2020

Changes:
-   Correct the date in commit 85 note, above.
-   Fix the Firmware version message in EBTKS.h

## Commit \#87 12/13/2020

Changes:
-   Add new feature to UNMOUNT. Now recognizes "SDCard"              --- not case-sensitive
-   Add new feature to MOUNT.   Now recognizes "SDCard", "anything"  --- not case-sensitive

## Commit \#88 12/16/2020

Changes:
-   Add diagnostic messages to MOUNT for mode 1, Create if LIF does not exits
-   Figured out why SD Card read access while copying Ref LIF image for create
    new virtual disk in MOUNT was randomly failing. When we changed from FIFO_SDIO
    mode to DMA_SDIO, the memory used for the temporary buffer for the copy
    operation became a problem, as it was in EXTMEM. Once it was changed to
    DMAMEM, the problems stopped.
-   Added a documentation section titled "Main Uses of DMAMEM" to EBTKS.cpp
-   In EBTKS_Bus_Interface_ISR.cpp , added note above pinChange_isr() reminding
    that the function prototype must include
>        __attribute__ ((interrupt ("IRQ")))

-   Now that MOUNT LIF create works, benchmark different read block sizes
-   General improvements to copy_sd_file() that catches errors better, and
    reports them. Part of MOUNT improvement.
-   General improvements to MOUNT error reporting and diagnostic prints.
-   Platformio.ini
>       Changed SdFat library from 2.0.0-beta.8 to 2.0.2-beta.3
>       Added "-Wl,--print-memory-usage" which better reports memory usage at
>       and of compile/Link

## Commit \#89 12/20/2020

Changes:
-   Exhaustive characterization of the timing delays within the very many
    parts of the Pin Change Interrupt
-   Added dump_devices_array() in EBTKS_Utilities.cpp , not currently used
-   There is an unresolved issue with the Serial Monitor command "media"
    with handling the printer association with the file
>      /printers/printfile.txt

-   There is an unresolved issue with the "printer is 310" assignment (which
    needs ROM 360 printer/plotter to be installed) does not actually seem to
    write to the associated file when PRINT ... command are given. This used
    to work.
-   There is an unresolved issue with the MOUNT/UNMOUNT "SDCard" crashing the
    system.

## Commit \#90 12/28/2020

Changes:
-   More Timing Analysis of the Pin Change Interrupt
-   Report Series 80 Model during boot, improve other boot messages
-   Re-organize the code around the SD.Begin()
-   Changed all the TXD_Pulser() to RXD_Pulser()
-   Minor documentation edit to platformio.ini
-   Updates to HPIB based Printing (to a file on the SD Card)
>       HpibDisk type becomes HpibDevice type
>       HpibDevice array now includes device type and Talk/Listen address (tla / _tla)
>       New virtual functions close() and getFilename()
>       New function to check device type isType()

-   Modify HPIBOutput if the character is EOL
-   Diagnostic terminal "media" command now lists printer output file
-   Detailed documentation in EBTKS.cpp describing the issues with FIFO_SDIO mode
    access to the SD Card, and our changing over to DMA_SDIO mode

## Commit \#91 12/29/2020

Changes:
-   Clean up formatting of this file

## Commit \#92 01/08/2020

Changes:
-   Ensure at least 5 us delay between consecutive DMA requests

## Commit \#93 01/26/2020

Changes:
-   Diagnostic code to reveal the actual cache configuration.
    At about line 725 in EBTKS.cpp  , commented out.
-   Integer power function, as used in the above diagnostic code.
-   Flush and delete dcache prior to reading ROM images from SD Card to DMAMEM
-   ROM storage area in DMAMEM now includes alignment to a 32 byte boundary

## Commit \#94 01/31/2020

Changes:
-   Remove DEVELOPMENT_MODE that was only used to control requiring the serial
    terminal to be connected for startup. Now controlled by CONFIG.TXT
-   Store the messages that might go to the HP85 CRT in a buffer, since PWO is
    still asserted when these messages are being created, and the CRT can't be
    accessed if PWO is asserted. Use the first 32 KB of the SDDEL buffer.
-   Store the initial messages that were going to the serial terminal in a the
    second half of the SDDEL buffer, 32 KB. The use the SDDEL 64 KB buffer for
    these two message streams is ok, since SDDEL can't be issued, since the HP85
    has not even started the boot process, and PWO is asserted. 32 KB for each
    of these two streams should be way more than needed. No checks are made for
    going off the end of the buffer.
-   Reporting all the parameter settings at the beginning of CONFIG.TXT to the
    serial output.
-   JSON DOC SIZE is now a parameter at the top of EBTKS_SD.cpp
-   Rename boot_log_ptr to log_to_CRT_ptr which is much clearer, and create a
    separate pointer for the stuff that will go to the serial port: log_to_serial_ptr
-   Add support to both reader and writer of the CONFIG.TXT for the new parameters
-   Resolve the correct combination of ROMs for Floppy emulation, 5 MB hard drive
    emulation, and whether the system is an HP85A or HP85B. Add comments into the
    CONFIG.TXT file as well. These are all AMIGO style drives. The Extended Mass
    Storage ROM (317) is only needed if a real HPIB card is installed and it has
    a SS/80 type disk drive attached.
-   Correct some HPIB select code defaults from 7 to 3.
-   Drive type reported to the serial port now identifies Floppys and 5 MB drives.
-   msus$ are now reported with the mount reporting to the serial port



## Commit \#95 02/03/2020

Changes:
-   Fixed random writing of characters to wrong location on CRT. Issue
    was not waiting for CRT controller to be idle before writing to
    CRTBAD. Bug was in Write_on_CRT_Alpha(). Removed the storied
    comments related to the bug. Was on the right track, but missed
    an instance of the bug. For safety, also checked that all references
    to both CRTBAD and CRTSAD are preceded by a test for not busy.
-   Improved handling of boot message to HP85 CRT and Boot messages that
    are sent to the Serial port (over USB). Both configurable by the
    CONFIG.TXT file. Serial stuff can now be configured to be repeated
    some number of seconds after boot has completed, with a countdown
    timer displayed in the serial stream.
-   Resolved issue with boot failing if we gated everything on the HP85
    reaching the idle loop, EXEC at 000072. The failing code had this
    wait in the setup() function, and it never completed. The reason is
    that part of the AUXROM startup is that it calls some EBTKS functions
    such as WROM so, and all the new keywords are handled in functions in
    the loop() function.
-   Report all the initial settings in CONFIG.TXT to the Serial port.
-   Got rid of all the arbitrary delays in the startup code. Can now get
    from power on to idle loop on HP85 in about 3 seconds, if we aren't
    waiting for the Serial port to become active. This will be the default.
-   Added __DATE__ and __TIME__ to the version info, so now the compiled
    code knows the time and date of compilation. So we no longer have to
    edit a string each time we do a release to correctly identify when
    it was built
-   Found a bug in the RGB LED code. LSB of all 3 bytes for both LEDs
    is always set. Planning to throw away all the C++ code and the FASTLED
    library for some hand crafted replacement. Coming to a code base
    near you, Real Soon Now (tm).
-   Moved and modified all boot message output code (CRT and Serial) from
    other modules to all be at the end of EBTKS.cpp
-   Changed all strcmp() calls to strcasecmp(). Need to look into
    improving the serial port diagnostic monitor, as it no longer needs
    to do case conversion on keyboard commands.
-   Per Russells "Head's up", changed handling of MachineName in SD
    startup code to creating a persistent copy if this parameter,
    rather than using a copy of the ephemeral pointer that would become
    undefined once the loadConfiguration() function finishes.
-   Disabled EMS support as it causes problems with HP85B. Almost certainly
    because of address clashes. this will also affect HP86 and 87. Added
    some new parameters to CONFIG.TXT in preparation for some future code
    that will allow peaceful co-existence. Currently disabled with a
    #define, not yet looking at CONFIG.TXT parameters.
-   Improved reporting of mount/unmount of LIF images to the Serial port,
    with the name of the LIF image. Now also correctly displays the
    virtual printer and tape assignment.

-   Added some diagnostics to EBTKS_LED.h to try and figure out why
    sending 0,0,0 doesn't turn the LED off. TLA5201 shows that all bytes
    sent have the LSB set regardless of the value (tested with 0 and 170
    which is 0xAA but 0xAB is transmitted) So looks like the bug is
    somewhere in the FASTLED library. Also it needs inverted data. As
    indicated above, I plan to write my own replacement rather than try
    and debug FASTLED.

## Commit \#96 02/03/2020

Changes:
-   Fix display of table in commit 95

## Commit \#97 02/03/2020

Changes:
-   Fix display of table in commit 95

## Commit \#98 02/04/2020

Changes:
-   Change all diagnostics that used TXD and RXD on Teensy Physical pins 9 and 10
    to instead use physical pin 25 (core pin 33) as SCOPE_1 and physical
    pin 31 (core pin 39) as SCOPE_2.
    Change all references RXD to SCOPE_1 and all references to TXD to SCOPE_2
    Doing this because these pins were intended for communications with the ESP32.
